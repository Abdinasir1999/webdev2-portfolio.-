      <p class="pfabook010">
          WhatsApp’s privacy setting gives the user the option to show his/hers profile
photo, status, if the person saw the message or not (by showing the two blue
ticks) and the last time the user was online.
To have access to change all of that, you simply need to: enter WhatsApp →
Settings → Account → Privacy.

             <h1 class="fb2-h1">Your Account Information</h1>
             <p class="pfabook010">
         Once you register on WhatsApp you will provide them your phone number
and basic information (such as your name). You will also be providing them
phone numbers from your mobile address book. You may also provide your
email, profile picture and “about information”.
      </p>
<h1 class="fb2-h1">Your Messages</h1>
    <p class="pfabook010">
        WhatsApp do not retain the user’s messages, once the message (audios,
videos, photos, chats...) are delivered, they are deleted from the server and it is
only stored on your on device.<br>
If a message is not delivered (if you are offline for example), <br>WhatsApp may
keep it for up to 30 days to try to deliver it. If the message is still undelivered
after 30 days, then it will be deleted.
WhatsApp offers “end-to-end encryption” which means that the user’s
messages are encrypted to protect against the app and third parties from
reading them.<br> It can only be read by you and the person who you are
communicating with. It isn’t possible to turn off the end-to-end encryption,
which means it is always activated.

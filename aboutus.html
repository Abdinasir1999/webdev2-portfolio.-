        <h4>Our Mission</h4>
        <p class="pfabook010about">Great advantage of social media in education is distance learning opportunities. There are many disadvantaged students who are not able to acquire formal education by attending regular classes in an educational institution. With the help of various online tools along with social media, modern educators are able to attract students through distance learning programs. Soon, this will be an inseparable part of our modern education system. Today, hosting live lectures via on social media is the way forward to allowing students who live in remote areas of the world to access education.<br> Therefore, it can be claimed that social media platforms, enabling free voice and video calls, the sharing of documents, links and any other type of information can be highly effective in improving the academic performance and students learning.

                <h4>A way to communicate with students</h4>
                <p class="pfabook010about2">In a university setting, social media can be incredibly useful when it comes to reaching out and engaging with students. It’s a less formal way for professors to communicate, showing students a more personal side while improving the teacher-student relationship.

A study that analysed the use of social networks as a communication tool between teachers found that that they primarily communicate through social networks for academic reasons.

Results of the study led researchers to conclude sthat teachers should use social networks as communication tools for purely academic-related issues, such as addressing aspects related to class organization and coursework. Teacher-student interaction in the social media sphere should be kept strictly professional.

The study also uncovered that teachers found Facebook and WhatsApp to be the most effective social media tools due to the popularity and versatility of Facebook, and the easy-to-use communicative abilities of WhatsApp.

Professors should also be careful about what they post and how much they wish to share with their students via social media platforms, as their online profile content could affect their credibility as an education professional.

They are advised to keep their profiles primarily for academic purposes or to keep their personal profiles private, creating a separate public profile for connecting with students or sharing academic-related content.

For students taking distance learning courses or for lectures with large class sizes, teachers can make themselves more accessible to students via social media.

They can hold ‘virtual office hours’ through Skype or get them to use Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp to raise questions they didn’t get the chance to in class.

        <h2 class="h2-fp1">Using Facebook for Teaching and Learning</h2>
        <p class="pfp-1">Social Media applications were not specifically designed for educational purposes, however it has
the potential to further education inside a classroom. 
 Facebook is most appropriate for discussing
and sharing world news and major events. The main reason Facebook is used is to connect with
friends, family etc. While Facebook is mainly used to connect with people you already know it can
also be a great tool for networking. Facebook creates a sense of community amongst its users
and this can lead to a widespread of ideas and collaborations.
<strong>
Similar to creating an online community Facebook can be used to strengthen communication.
Students and teachers and students and their peers are now able to share and join their work
together easier than ever. Students can now communicate with their classmates and teachers
            </strong>
about their course content, besides from this they can also arrange times to work on group
projects.<br> 
    
Another way Facebook can be used for teaching and educational benefits is the development of
computer skills. Students are developing writing and communication skills through self-expressing
posts as well as several other skills such as editing and proofreading.

   <h1 class="h2-fp101">Using Massenger for Teaching and Learning </h1>
   <p> The teacher could communicate the project with the students and all the details and post anything necessary to do it, instantly to a large group of students. 

The students and teachers can share any multimedia to eachother. For example learning resources like videos or links to websites… or any sort of project the students create, they can share it.
A teacher wants some students to do a project on games. They will send a group of students individually what they have to do for the project and how it will be graded. They will send them links to start off or to learn about the topic, websites, videos, etc. 

The students doing the project create their own group chat and assign project roles and talk about how they are going to execute the project. They can use the resources and their research to accomplish the project within the grading guide set by the teacher by sharing information.

        <h2 class="h2-p2">Using snapchat for Teaching and Learning</h2>
        <p class="pfp-1"> There are many ways that snapchat can be used for educational purposes. Here are
some examples:
Q&amp;A’s are very helpful with snapchat as it is not as formal as using email. It sparks a
better connection between the teacher and student, therefore the student may be
able to take in the information given to them easier. <br> 
Another useful tool that snapchat has is the ability to create group chats for
homework, useful links, notes, etc. What’s even better is the group call tool, this may
not work as well with a large group but with a smaller group of students this could be
very useful. It gives that person to person feel when you could be all be in
completely different locations.
Snapchat has this tool where stories are taken down after 24 hours which would be
useful for students who have any questions or need help with something. It is up
long enough for the teacher to read but also it is automatically taken down after the
24 hour period giving anonymity and privacy to the student.

Stories are also useful for teachers to upload homework, reminders, notes and even
questions for their students. Stories could be used for students to take part in
quizzes or even links to useful videos or articles etc.<strong> 
Either way the possibilities are near unlimited when it comes to snapchat, it is a very
fun way to educate and stay connected with your students.</strong>

        <h2 class="h2-p3">Using Instagram for Teaching and Learning</h2>
        <P class="pfp-2"> Students can use Instagram to create a photo gallery of their photos or projects in art class.
This gives parents, students and teachers to see their work, like and comment. It can also
lead to them gaining followers that like their work and build a future portfolio and following
which will be useful in the future.</P>  <iframe class="yu-v"width="260" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9N9I0yRilVE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h2 class="h2-p4">Using Whats-App for Teaching and Learning</h2>
        <P class="pfp-3">WhatsApp comes into play very handy when passing notes to
classmates if you missed any important information.<br>Especially in a third level education it gives certain people a chance to
text their friends and know where to catch up. Being able to directly talk to students, send lecture notes
and pass on any important data would in fact bring ideas not
only for the students but to get feedback in how the work
can be presented making it simpler for the teacher.<br> </P>

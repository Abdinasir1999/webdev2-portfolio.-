       <h1 class="fb-h1">Why Instagram?
</h1>
     <p class="pfabook010"> Instagram is a free social media platform which allows users to share pictures and videos
with other users. Instagram allows it users to edit pictures and videos in app. Instagram
allows users to ‘tag’ users in pictures and videos . the company was founded in 2010 by
Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. It was later acquired by Facebook in 2012 for 200 million
dollars. Users can like and comment on phots and videos. It is also a useful business tool as
small business can use this to promote there products and show how they work through
short videos. It can also be used too direct adds towards a specific person according to
Instagram 1 million advertisers around the world se Instagram too promote. Its available
both as a app for android and iOS and a website.</p>
               <h1 class="fb-h1">The app
</h1>

      <p class="pfabook010">
          Paige didn’t become active on Instagram until few year ago. Two main reasons brought her to the platform. One is that her students are all on Instagram, but are not using it in professional ways. This is so spot on. I learned from my own teaching experience that our students, so-called digital natives, are not necessarily digitally savvy. They are adept at using social media for personal communication and entertainment purposes, but not in terms of business and professional usage of social media as a strategic communication tool.<br>
The second reason that brought Paige to Instagram is its visual components. People are naturally drawn to pictures. As we all say, “a picture is worth a thousand words.” More people are using Instagram to engage in in visual storytelling. Even among scientists, Instagram is gaining popularity and momentum.

          Social media is called social media for a reason. It’s all about making personal connections with people. <br>If you are just using social media, especially Instagram, as a broadcasting tool, you are not going to get the power out of it that you will if you use it to form a community.<br> Find other people who share your interest. <br>Follow them.<br> Chat with them.<br> Send them messages.<br> Comment on their pictures.<br> starting building a community around yourself of people who are interested in what you are interested in.<br> Then you start to see the power of Instagram.

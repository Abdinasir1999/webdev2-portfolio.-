      <p class="pfabook010sn1">
         Snapchat is an app that is available on the app store (apple) and the
google play store (android). It is a simple app. Once you download it andS
make an account it is amazing what you can do! You can send and
receive videos and photos from your ‘friends’ once you have added them.<br>
You can also post to your ‘story’ which is something that all your friends
can see.<br> It is kind of like posting a status on Facebook or tweeting on
Twitter.<br> You can block certain people from seeing it. <br>You can also make a
‘Private’ story which is one where you are in control of who you add to see
the story. There are also public stories on snapchat and shows. From
MTV to Beauty Insider, you can watch different mini shows or read
articles.<br> You can subscribe to certain mini shows or even news stories, so
you never miss one! You can also chat to people without sending a video
or picture, just like texting. <br>There are also group-chats on the app in which you can have all your friends in
one spot to text or snapchat.
   <h1 class="fb-h1sn">Humanize the Teacher as a Real Person</h1>
    <p class="pfabook010sn">This isn’t necessarily something I consciously do, but rather is an innate side-effect of using social media. With that said, it’s probably one of the most important parts of being on social media. Students tend to be afraid of teachers, a LOT. Even though you might think you are the friendliest person on earth, there is a power distance that separates teachers from students. Approaching teachers, even when asking legitimate class-related questions, can make students feel intimidated and stressed. Using Snapchat along with Twitter and Facebook to share my personal and professional life has helped me communicate to the students that I am a real person like them. I laugh, sleep, work, grade papers, teach, shop, complain (sometimes), and procrastinate (never! ;). But the point is, sharing some parts of myself in my “natural environment” helps build a rapport with students that wouldn’t otherwise exist. And this is extremely helpful for facilitating their learning and engagement in the classroom.</p>

       <h1 class="fb2-h1">Engage Students Through Snapchat Q&A & Geofilters</h1>
      <p class="pfabook010sn">There are multiple ways that you can use Snapchat to engage students. Doing a Snapchat Q&A is one of my favorites. For example, when you receive a question from a student via email, rather than emailing back, respond to that question via Snapchat. I can almost guarantee that receiving a personalized response from a professor will blow a student away. It instantaneously connects you, the “superior,” and the student. Plus, who doesn’t love taking a break from answering and responding to emails? The Snapchat Q&A approach works particularly well with those students with whom you already have a better connection. Sometimes, a simple question and answer can lead to an insightful discussion about a class topic or career related issues. I love it when these extended discussions happen. You can feel by the end of a Snapchat Q&A that you are closer to the student and the student feels more comfortable at talking to you. The “face-to-face” and one-on-one communication via Snapchat allows you to transmit what would be lost by using emails.
Another fun way to involve students is to ask them to create class-specific Geofilters (see the image below). My students love this exercise, and sometimes I offer them extra credit to do so. In this way, they earn course credit and learn an important tactical skill that benefit their careers — win-win. Below is one example of a Geofilter created by one of my students using our class hashtags, #AZSM.

       <h1 class="fb2-h1">Brand the students and the class</h1>
       <p class="pfabook010sn">In today’s information- and noise-loaded environment, differentiation is crucial to help an individual or a brand stand out. I use Snapchat to give my students shout outs and highlight their accomplishments. For example,a few weeks ago, I had four students join me on a #HootChat. I was so excited that they took charge of their learning and then created this Snapchat story (see the image below). Several individuals and even Hootsuite itself chatted back about the contributions these students made to the discussion, and then I shared the feedback with the students. Cool, right?

        <h4>Communication And Collaboration</h4>
          <p class="div0p01">The biggest advantage of social media is better communication. A student can connect with anyone at any point in time via Kids Messenger or WhatsApp. They can use such platforms via their smartphone, tablet or computer, and learners can exchange questions, make phone calls or video calls. If a student is stuck with their homework, they can always communicate with their friends or tutors. They donâ€™t need to wait and meet the teacher physically. Social media promote learning by offering support with sharing documents as well such as via Google Drive Box, Google Docs. Some teachers even connect with their class via Facebook live, as this American teacher does by reading bedtime stories to her students every evening. </p>
          
          <h4 class="h402">Finding Concrete Information Online</h4>
          <p class="p02"> Various websites and social media networks are providing plenty of information that can be helpful to students. Via social media news feeds, students can find informational and relevant websites they want to follow so as to be kept in the loop. Depending on their interests, students can find answers to their questions. Sites, such as Tumblr and Pinterest, can offer children inspirations for school projects or practical problem-solving.
The educational benefits of social networking sites are also those that help students prepare for important lessons and learn certain concepts with great efficacy. Social media websites will contain the latest data on various school subjects and thus, the students have the opportunity to survey and look into what is new. Social media is a Wikipedia for students these days. We are witnessing an era of social media learning.
 </p>
          
          <h4 class="h0403">Improved Literacy, Communication, And Reading Skills</h4>
          <p class="div0p01">It is usually observed that students are bored of reading and writing, however, the internet and social media provide plenty of online information which often students are more inclined to read, especially if these pieces of information include eye-catching animations. Online messages, comments, news, articles, and books provide an endless list of information to be read, and students are motivated to devote their time and put some extra efforts towards their learning.
Such online activities contribute to the child's general learning, and kids eventually develop stronger reading habits resulting in a drastic improvement in their writing abilities. Social media sites are in the most part interactive and this definitely keeps the student involved.

         <h4 class="h403">Distance Learning Opportunities</h4>
        <p class="p02">Another great advantage of social media in education is distance learning opportunities. There are many disadvantaged students who are not able to acquire formal education by attending regular classes in an educational institution. With the help of various online tools along with social media, modern educators are able to attract students through distance learning programs. Soon, this will be an inseparable part of our modern education system. Today, hosting live lectures via Skype or webinars via WebinarJam is the way forward to allowing students who live in remote areas of the world to access education.
